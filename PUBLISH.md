# How to Publish to GitHub

Your plugin is ready! Follow these steps to publish it:

## Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

Go to: https://github.com/new

Fill in:
- **Repository name**: `meshtelegramplugin`
- **Description**: `MeshCentral plugin that sends Telegram notifications when new devices are registered. Includes device info: IP, CPU, GPU, RAM, antivirus status, and more.`
- **Visibility**: ✅ Public
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

Click **Create repository**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run:

```bash
cd /Users/duboki/Desktop/meshtelegramplugin
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your plugin will be live at: `https://github.com/polacojulian/meshtelegramplugin`

## Step 3: Install in MeshCentral

Users can now install your plugin using:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polacojulian/meshtelegramplugin/main/config.json
```

## Important Note

⚠️ **Security Reminder**: The current `telegram_notifier.js` includes example Telegram credentials. These are YOUR real credentials from the request.

The README already instructs users to replace credentials after installation.
